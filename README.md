HotSpot is a social map of campus where people pin locations deserving of interest. Those watching the maps can then profit from others' discoveries, and events can grow bigger and bigger as more people stop by. Live asynchronous updates keep everyone on the same page, and the ability to tag locations helps people learn about what exactly is happening. But the notifications aren't permanent—these “heat maps” disappear slowly, after the moment of interest has passed.

We try to keep this live [here](http://hotspot.meteor.com) for now, but we intend to get permanent hosting soon.
